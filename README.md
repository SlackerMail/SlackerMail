# SlackerMail

SlackerMail is a Slackware virtual mail server, much like and inspired by iRedMail.
I made this because Slackware is my favorite form of Linux, and iRedMail doesn't 
support Slackware. This latest version .026 is a release candidate.

You'll need to do steps 1-3 in my SlackerMail How-To before you can run this script.
Here is the website for that How-To: https://the-slacker.com/

To install SlackerMail:

tar -xf SlackerMail-.026.tar.gz

cd SlackerMail-.026

./SlackerMail.sh

If you run into any problems with the installation of this script please let me know at:
