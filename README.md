# SlackerMail

SlackerMail is a Slackware virtual mail server, much like and inspired by iRedMail.
I made this because Slackware is my favorite form of Linux, and iRedMail doesn't 
support Slackware. It is still beta, so use at your own risk. I've set it up on my
test VPS a good many times, and it seems to work pretty well for me at this point.

You'll need to do steps 1-3 in my SlackerMail How-To before you can run this script.
Here is the website for that How-To: https://the-slacker.com/

To install SlackerMail:<br>
tar -xf SlackerMail-.021.tar.gz
cd SlackerMail-.021
./SlackerMail.sh

If you run into any problems with the installation of this script please let me know at:
